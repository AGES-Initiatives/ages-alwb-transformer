<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>
These services are provided by AGES Initiatives, Inc. and were generated using AGES Liturgical Workbench.
</p>
<p>They are provided as an ePub file so that you can view them offline (when you do not have Internet access) and so that you can easily make the font larger. 
</p>
<p>Before the text of each service, there is an outline.  The outline allows you to learn the structure of the service. There are links in the outline to take you to the full text.</p>
<p>After the text of the service, there are one or more indexes, depending on how many languages are included.  The indexes include the first few words of text that is spoken out loud.  This way, if you arrive after a service has started, you can more easily find the point in the service to view on the reader.
</p>
<p>
Please note that when viewing bilingual services, if you make the font very large, some words might not fit on a line.  In such cases, the ending of the word will wrap around to the next line.  If your eReader doesn't know how to hyphenate a particular language (e.g. Greek), it will break the word, but without a hyphen mark.  If you do not want this, simply make the font smaller. Also, some eReaders might justify the text.  If you do not want the text to be justified, look for a setting in your reader that allows you to turn it off.
